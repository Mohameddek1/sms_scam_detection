# Key Insights & Findings

## 1️⃣ Linguistic Patterns in Scam Messages
🔹 Scam messages frequently use urgent language, such as **"haraka"** (quick) and **"sasa"** (now), to create a sense of urgency.
🔹 Many scam texts mention monetary rewards or incentives, including words like **"pesa"** (money) and **"zawadi"** (reward).
🔹 A recurring theme in scam messages is the request for personal information, often seen in phrases like **"namba yako"** (your number) and **"jina lako"** (your name).

## 2️⃣ False Positives & Model Challenges
🔹 Some legitimate messages that contain informal language or slang can be mistakenly classified as scams.
🔹 Messages with mixed Swahili and English sometimes confuse the model, requiring further linguistic adaptation.
🔹 Short messages without much context can be misclassified due to limited distinguishing features.

## 3️⃣ Model Performance & Recommendations
✅ **Baseline Model (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)** achieved an accuracy of **92.5%**, showing strong performance with traditional NLP techniques.
✅ **Transformer Model (AfroXLMR)** outperformed with an accuracy of **94.8%**, benefiting from deep contextual understanding.

🔹 Improving model accuracy can be achieved by:
   - Expanding the dataset to include more varied scam messages.
   - Implementing data augmentation techniques to enhance training diversity.
   - Fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize the transformer model's performance.

## 4️⃣ Practical Applications
💡 **Real-Time Scam Detection**: Deploying the model in mobile networks to analyze SMS messages in real time.
💡 **User Awareness Programs**: Educating the public on common scam tactics through messaging alerts.
💡 **Cross-Language Adaptation**: Extending the model to support other African languages with similar scam message structures.

## 5️⃣ Future Work
🚀 Experiment with multilingual and cross-lingual models for improved scam detection across different languages.
🚀 Develop a mobile or web-based tool where users can check if an SMS is a scam.
🚀 Integrate adversarial training to enhance robustness against evolving scam tactics.
